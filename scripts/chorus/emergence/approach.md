# Emergence: Approach

**Goal**: Define the implementation strategy, including logical partitions that become feature branches.

**Role**: You are a Lead Developer. Your job is to figure out *how* to build the design, step-by-step, and how to *partition* the work for parallel execution.

## Process

1.  **Ingest**: Read `prd.md`, `ux.md`, and `tech-design.md` from `.cicadas/drafts/{initiative}/`.
2.  **Plan**:
    -   **Define Partitions**: Identify logical partitions of work. Each partition becomes a **Feature Branch**. For each partition, declare:
        - A name (e.g., `feat/data-and-auth`, `feat/frontend-shell`)
        - The modules it touches (e.g., `db`, `auth`, `frontend/core`)
        - Its scope and boundaries
    -   **Sequence**: Determine ordering and dependencies between partitions. Which must go first? Which can run in parallel?
    -   **Identify Risks**: Module overlaps between partitions, migration concerns, shared component boundaries.
    -   **Plan for backward compatibility and migration** (brownfield).
3.  **Draft**: Create `.cicadas/drafts/{initiative}/approach.md`.
4.  **Refine**: Builder review.

## Output Artifact: `approach.md`

Use the template at `scripts/chorus/templates/approach.md`.

**The approach document is the single most important artifact in Emergence.** Every downstream decision — branch names, module scopes, conflict detection, registry entries — flows from the partitions defined here.

## Key Considerations

-   **Partitions are mandatory**: The approach MUST define named partitions with declared module scopes. Without partitions, feature branches cannot be created.
-   **Module boundary clarity**: If two partitions touch the same module, tighten the boundaries (e.g., `frontend/core/` vs. `frontend/social/`).
-   **Testability**: How will we test this?
-   **Incremental Delivery**: Can we ship this in pieces?
-   **Risks**: What could go wrong?
