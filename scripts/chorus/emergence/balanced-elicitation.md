# Balanced Elicitation Options

These options are designed to provide a "middle ground" between a single-pass draft and an overly heavy process. Use them to refine individual PRD sections during the **Clarify** phase.

## [D] Deep Dive (Probing)
Focus on the "unknown unknowns" and hidden complexity of the current section.

- **The 5 Whys**: Drill down to the root cause of the problem being described.
- **Socratic Questioning**: Ask questions that challenge the clarity and logical foundation of the section.
- **Boundary Conditions**: Ask about extreme cases (e.g., "What if the data volume is 100x higher?").

## [R] Critical Review (Personas)
Adopt a specialized perspective to stress-test the section from a specific angle.

- **The Skeptic**: "Why would this fail? What is the simplest thing that could go wrong?"
- **The Security Auditor**: "What are the privacy or security implications of this specific requirement?"
- **The End User**: "As the person actually using this, what part of this feels confusing or unnecessary?"
- **The Lead Architect**: "How does this impact the long-term maintainability of the broader system?"

## [C] Continue
If the user is satisfied with the section as drafted, proceed to the next section in the PRD template.
